Risk
====

Java code repository for the Risk artificial intelligence project done by Dirk Brand for a Bsc Honours in Computer Science degree at the University of Stellenbosch.  The computer players used for the research component (both the expectiminimax and Monte Carlo tree search players), are also included.  For information on the results of the research, please contact me directly.

This project is completely open source and any further work on it would be greatly appreciated.  Collaboration is encouraged!

If anyone would like to sponsor some Bitcoin for further projects in Monte Carlo tree search work, please send to the following address: 14QrgzjVVVuewsR7DCWMtpU9ZXeDqokmCH
